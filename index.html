<h2>Defend with Words</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Players use words to defend the planet from asteroids and alien invaders
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players will feel anxious, and frantic as the words pile up.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Typing/Base defender
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The players type words and hit enter to destroy things as them come in to deal damage to your planet.  Your planet shoots rockets that deal damage to the enemy planet.  Players are able to upgrade the speed at which the rockets shoot.  They can also attack the aliens on the screen or upgrade to have a shield that defends from asteroids.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
You are a planet attempting to defend itself from the dangers of space.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
Your planet is drifting through space, only words can save you from asteroids and aliens.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Two types of enemies attack the planet.  Asteroids fly directly into the planet.  Aliens move around untill they are defeated.  To kill enemies simply type the word attached to them and hit enter.  Delete works.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Text and typing input in phaser and javascript. Also some data structures in javascript.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
No typing games exist in the Phaser examples.  No of the phaser 1.6 examples even take text inputs from the users.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target audience is anyone who can type without looking at the keyboard.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Depends on the skill of the player but most games could last 5-10 minutes.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The only strategy would be to ignore the asteroids. Since its much more difficult to catch those befor they collide.
</li>

<li><strong>Estimated Schedule:</strong>
The part that took the longest was the core mechanic.  The typing and deleting the users inputs.
</li>

<li><strong>Team:</strong>
I type extremely slow.  If I wanted others who could help me win I would choose people with strong typing skills.
</li>

<li><strong>Assets:</strong>
Music from OpenGameArt
Sprites from Game Assets created by Krasi Wasilev
The GUI outlines are from OpenGameArt
</li>

<li><strong>Closest Phaser Example:</strong>
None
